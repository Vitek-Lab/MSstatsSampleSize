\title{Example of output from estimateVar function}
\format{
A list with five elements
}
\usage{
variance_estimation
}
\description{
It is the output of \code{\link{estimateVar}} function with two inputs:
\code{\link{OV_SRM_train}} and \code{\link{OV_SRM_train_annotation}}.
The list should include the required elements as below.
}
\details{
\itemize{
  \item data : the input data matrix with log2 protein abundance.
  \item model : the list of linear models trained for each protein.
  \item mu : the mean abundance matrix of each protein in each condition
  \item sigma : the standard deviation matrix of each protein
  in each condition
  \item promean: the mean abundance vector of each protein
  across all the samples
  \item promean: the standard deviation vector of each protein
  across all the samples.
  \item protein : proteins, correpsonding to the rows
  in \emph{mu} and \emph{sigma} or the element of \emph{promean}
}
