<h3>Protein Proportion</h3>
<hr>
Proportion of total number of proteins in the input data to simulate. <br>

<i>For example</i><br>
Input data has 1,000 proteins and user selects a value of <b>0.1</b>. Proteins 
are ranked in decreasing order based on their mean abundance across all the 
samples. Then, <b>1,000 * 0.1 = 100</b> proteins will be selected from the top
list to simulate. <b>Default is 1.0</b>, which means that all the proteins will 
be used.
